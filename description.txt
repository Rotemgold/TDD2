We used API used for search books called openlibrary , with this API we used for search
books by author name.
The first feature we made is to view all books that found from author search and view them
in reverse order from z to a(the names we received from API is ordered from a to z) and
make the first letter in each name to be Capital.
The second feature is to take all the subjects in the books we found from the search and
view them in a list and make the first letter for each subject name to be Capital.
